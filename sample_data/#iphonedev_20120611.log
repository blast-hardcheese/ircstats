[00:27:48] <neeku> i want something that sticks behind, but adding it as a subview to the main view doesn't help either
[00:28:50] <granden> I know how to set image tint and tint for the tabbar in xcode/storyboard. But how do I set the tint color for a non selcted tab?
[00:28:55] <brownies> i can't believe there's a line. how ridiculous.

[00:48:21] <JonathanThompson> I'm not aware of an NSStack, but that's very easy to implement using an NSArray.
[00:48:40] <shuaib> JonathanThompson, then what was your "yes" for? :) Any queue?
[00:48:45] <shuaib> I could use a queue or a stack
[00:49:00] <JonathanThompson> A queue is also easy to implement using NSArray :)
[00:49:06] *** Joins: Beelsebob (~Beelsebob@213.235.0.222)
[00:49:21] <shuaib> JonathanThompson, indeed, I was hoping standard cocoa libs would have something prepackaged
[00:49:22] <JonathanThompson> NSArray has more than one backend implementation, depending on how it has been used.
[00:49:25] <shuaib> instead of me having to implement it
[00:50:03] <hollance> you don't need to implement anything, simply use NSArray
[00:50:17] *** Quits: Beelsebob (~Beelsebob@213.235.0.222) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:50:18] <JonathanThompson> Well, if you don't absolutely need Obj-C objects and are using older straight C or C++ type things, C++ works fine with Objective-C, too, and STL has all those.
[00:50:36] <granden> neeku: Thanks a lot. But regarding your problem, I dont really know.

[00:51:33] <neeku> "
[00:52:19] <JonathanThompson> I don't know of a good way to make that work that doesn't have performance problems, if that even works.
[00:53:07] <JonathanThompson> And the only thing that comes to mind is making (if this is possible) whatever is transparent in the webview truly transparent, and having it over the desired parent view (ie. webview the childview of the background view)

[00:54:26] <JonathanThompson> There may actually be no viable solution, neeku, other than adding a background as part of the DOM of the webview.

[01:04:12] <A_Nub> Just finished up a small demo in a couple hours :)
[01:04:14] <A_Nub> http://d.pr/v/IbtH
[01:04:25] <A_Nub> JonathanThompson: this is what the dequeuing was all about :)
[01:04:50] <Netshroud> chewed-on: IIRC I think it was a sample for a persistent connection
[01:05:09] <chewed-on> what do you mean by persistent connection ?
[01:05:25] <chewed-on> I thought the Push Notification just sits on the server and waits for input ?
[01:05:35] <Netshroud> so you always have a connection open to APNS, and just send along a message when you need to
[01:05:44] <Netshroud> instead of opening a connection for every batch of messages
[01:05:49] <chewed-on> oh right.
[01:05:52] <chewed-on> Hmm ok.
[01:05:54] <A_Nub> Just need to finish up the whole dequeue deal, and add in auto layout, some hardcoded numbers for now
[01:05:57] <A_Nub> and it will be done :)
[01:06:05] <Netshroud> check the code to make sure that's what it is, but I seem to remember that
[01:06:14] <A_Nub> And add some default presentation styles.
[01:06:31] <neeku> JonathanThompson, could you please explain it a bit mor win detail?
[01:06:43] <neeku> s/mor win/more in
[01:07:59] <JonathanThompson> neeku: that's the first time I've ever heard of someone trying to have a background of anything where they specifically did not want it to also expand with pinch-zooming or any zooming, soâ¦ I honestly don't know how that could be done short of your own UIView you implemented everything on.

[01:09:42] * JonathanThompson wonders if A_Nub responded at exactly the right time to catch him not connected :P
[01:09:58] <chewed-on> Netshroud: I notice the sample code shows that it is sending 10 messages in the main loop, I assume I am meant to perform some detection code there instead ?
[01:10:06] <neeku> Netshroud, let me check and tell you the result
[01:10:17] <Netshroud> you know what, chewed-on, let me actually download the code and check :P
[01:10:27] <chewed-on> ^.^! ok
[01:10:35] <Netshroud> sample_push or sample_server?
[01:10:40] <chewed-on> code.google.com/p/apns-php/source/browser/trunk/sample_server.php
[01:10:49] <A_Nub> JonathanThompson: yes they are UIViews :)
[01:11:02] <A_Nub> well not quite
[01:11:04] <A_Nub> but they are
[01:11:12] <A_Nub> I have a custom subclass
[01:11:18] <A_Nub> that stores a reuse id
[01:11:19] <A_Nub> but
[01:11:22] <A_Nub> it's unused atm
[01:11:24] <A_Nub> and not quite needed
[01:11:35] <A_Nub> So technically they are just UIViews for now.
[01:11:39] <A_Nub> just in a wrapper.
[01:12:21] <Netshroud> hmm
[01:12:23] <JonathanThompson> re you currently or are you planning on creating your own UIContainerViewController (or whatever the name is) for this?
[01:12:34] <Netshroud> I have no idea what php-apns server does internally. at all.
[01:13:03] <Netshroud> I thought php didn't have multiple threads/processes?
[01:13:11] <A_Nub> JonathanThompson: me?
[01:13:15] <A_Nub> No it works just like a tableView.
[01:13:17] <A_Nub> no need.
[01:13:37] * JonathanThompson shrugs
[01:13:54] <chewed-on> Netshroud: I think I remember reading that it starts a new process periodically to keep the connection "alive".
[01:13:57] <A_Nub> here's the interface if you are interested https://gist.github.com/9775a212416263207dc1
[01:14:14] <Netshroud> it looks like it just forks a whole bunch of processes and has a connection on each one
[01:14:15] <A_Nub> It will go public when it's all done and I finish documenting my whole ZTKit

[01:14:50] <JonathanThompson> OK :)
[01:14:54] <chewed-on> Netshroud: no problem, thanks for the help anyhow.
[01:15:03] <hollance> i'm pretty sure php-apns isn't actually a server
[01:15:07] <hollance> unless they changed it recently
[01:15:18] <A_Nub> JonathanThompson: it's for this company http://inze.it/
[01:15:23] <Netshroud> ApnsPHP_Push_Server is a weird form of server
[01:15:26] <A_Nub> which has one of the sexiest websites I have seen.
[01:15:35] <A_Nub> Both in cotent and interface.
[01:15:38] <A_Nub> :)
[01:15:44] <JonathanThompson> Contract you're currently working on?
[01:15:45] <A_Nub> and it's SFW
[01:15:49] <chewed-on> Netshroud: why is that ?
[01:16:02] <A_Nub> JonathanThompson: I wish, he did want to hire me, but this is just a small side gig
[01:16:14] <A_Nub> So I will have to talk to him after this.
[01:16:26] <Netshroud> chewed-on: It's a class that manages a bunch of sub-processes to do the connections, but I don't see how you could ever implement that on a live PHP web system

[01:19:44] <A_Nub> spent
[01:19:48] <A_Nub> getting all the details right
[01:20:00] <A_Nub> but basically the position of the scrollbar is used to calculate EVERYTHING

[01:20:27] <A_Nub> That's obviously not the audience.
[01:20:35] <khismetix> Anyone here done a branch in git from within Xcode 4 ?
[01:20:51] <A_Nub> I won't use xcode for scm
[01:20:54] <A_Nub> idk why
[01:20:55] <khismetix> We've delivered a build of app to Apple and want to branch to develop new features into a planned update
[01:20:59] <khismetix> indeed
[01:21:07] <khismetix> alternatively I just need to know how to branch in git cmd line
[01:21:09] <hollance> making a branch works OK in my experience
[01:21:16] <hollance> merging, on the other hand...
[01:21:16] <khismetix> hollance . v good
[01:21:20] <khismetix> okâ¦ :)
[01:21:23] <A_Nub> khismetix: git checkout -b newBranchName
[01:21:44] <hollance> personally, i'd use GitBox, SourceTree or another tool
[01:21:45] <khismetix> when you checkout -b newBranchName will xcode now point to the new branch ?
[01:21:57] <khismetix> which of the above are free, hollance  ?
[01:21:57] <hollance> first close Xcode, though!
[01:22:02] <hollance> SourceTree is
[01:22:06] <khismetix> ok
[01:22:16] <khismetix> ok.. so say we do git checkout -b
[01:22:27] <khismetix> and close down xcode beforehand
[01:22:38] <khismetix> how will xcode know that we are now developing on that branch ?

[01:22:47] <khismetix> do we need to do some fiddly stuff in xcode organizer ?
[01:22:47] <A_Nub> that's stored in the .git
[01:22:53] <khismetix> ah ok
[01:22:55] <A_Nub> nope
[01:23:02] <A_Nub> the files you see are part of that branch
[01:23:02] <khismetix> interesting
[01:23:05] <A_Nub> git is magical
[01:23:13] <khismetix> neato
[01:23:14] <A_Nub> it replaces files with the version you are on
[01:23:23] <A_Nub> so you only see w.e version you are on
[01:23:31] <khismetix> so, if there are 2 developers sharing the git repo using bitbutcket
[01:23:35] <A_Nub> then again it's not magical svn is similar.
[01:23:41] <khismetix> if both checkout the same branch in cmd line
[01:23:46] <A_Nub> They should work in separate branches!
[01:23:53] <khismetix> ok..
[01:23:55] <khismetix> I should explain
[01:23:59] <khismetix> one developer is coding
[01:24:07] <A_Nub> bitbucket doesn't know or care whos were.
[01:24:08] <khismetix> the other is â¦ advising and code reviewing
[01:24:23] <khismetix> sure.. but checkins will be on the correct branch right ?
[01:24:26] <khismetix> pushes I mean
[01:24:37] <khismetix> pushes back to the remote repo on bitbucket
[01:24:39] <A_Nub> if they are pushed to the right branch
[01:24:43] <khismetix> so long as both developers
[01:24:48] <khismetix> yes.. ok and that is my question
[01:24:50] <A_Nub> git push origin branchName
[01:24:54] <khismetix> is there any additional configuration
[01:24:54] <khismetix> ok
[01:24:57] <A_Nub> nope
[01:24:58] <khismetix> important
[01:25:02] <khismetix> right
[01:25:07] <A_Nub> just git checkout -b newBranch
[01:25:11] <khismetix> so git push origin branchName
[01:25:14] <A_Nub> git push origin newBranch
[01:25:20] <A_Nub> now to switch to existing branches
[01:25:25] <khismetix> git push origin along would push to the trunk ??
[01:25:26] <A_Nub> just git checkout branchName
[01:25:42] <A_Nub> you have to call merge

[01:48:03] <Biappi> we use it for logging, but i can't understand how much time passes between the app reporting an event, and the event being reported in the dashboard
[01:48:32] <khismetix> neekers : because bitbucket is free
[01:48:38] <neekers> ahh
[01:48:46] <khismetix> and company is short on $$$
[01:48:54] <neekers> does bitbucket have private repos for free?
[01:48:57] <khismetix> free for up to 4 devs
[01:48:58] <khismetix> Yes
[01:49:02] <neekers> ahh
[01:49:24] <khismetix> What we want to play with is a simple repo,  a.c, b.c on master
[01:49:26] <khismetix> then branch

[02:15:06] <brownies> however, you will have a much happier time using viewDidLoad, as it allows Apple's default loadView to do its magic of creating self.view in a nice way

[02:15:24] <brownies> which, to me, is a big win.

[03:10:13] <sepho> I've a NSNumberFormatter for format a NSString, here is the code: http://pastebin.com/pwsipeXE  the problem is respuestaUsuario is 3.30 string and after numberFromString is called, myNumber has 3.3 as value, instead of 3.30 â¦ and i NEED to store 3.30. Is there any way to use that functions without removing last zero?
[03:10:39] <dang`r`us> sepho, I'm afraid that numbers don't work that way
[03:10:48] <dang`r`us> sepho, may I ask why you need to store 3.30?
[03:11:04] <real_care> 3.3 and 3.30 are the same thing
[03:11:19] <real_care> it sounds like you NEED to print 3.30
[03:11:21] <dang`r`us> what real_care said, and also: you cannot store exact numbers, at least not when using floats or doubles
[03:11:24] <neekers> no, they are not the same thing.
[03:11:32] <neekers> one has more precision than the other.
[03:11:49] <real_care> they both have the same value
[03:11:52] <real_care> it's a moot point
[03:11:52] <dang`r`us> 3.3 and 3.30 are the same value, but the precision information is different, that's correct
[03:12:00] <dang`r`us> however floats do not store precision information.
[03:12:09] <dang`r`us> or the exact value of 3.3 for that matter.
[03:12:30] <neekers> real_care: obviously you have never taken any advanced science classes.
[03:12:46] <real_care> hey neekers get off my dick
[03:12:54] <dang`r`us> NSNumber (the type you get from numberFromString:) uses several internal types, in your case it will probably use float or double
[03:13:06] <JonathanThompson> Floating point values are deceptive in what they do/don't represent correctly at times, real_care, I've seen people get nailed from that more than once.
[03:13:15] <neekers> real_care: don't pretend to say things that you aren't sure of.
[03:13:27] <dang`r`us> neekers, methinks it's just a semantic quibble
[03:13:30] <real_care> ^
[03:13:31] <dang`r`us> the value is obviously the same
[03:13:48] <neekers> dang`r`us: it's not.
[03:13:51] <real_care> yeah dude take your elitest bullshit and shove it, it really does not matter

[03:14:18] <neekers> thank you real_care, great argument.
[03:14:23] <dang`r`us> neekers, the point is that floats do not store precision information, so you cannot distinguish float foo = 3.3; and float bar = 3.30;
[03:14:33] <dang`r`us> and we're dealing with floats here
[03:14:40] <dang`r`us> let's not confuse sepho further :)
[03:14:41] <sepho> yes real_care but I've developed an app that ask a user for an answer (it's an educational app) and when user reads the sentence, the correct answer is 3.30 (for example; If I've $4 and I spent 30cnts, How much do I have?) so the user puts 3.30 in the box and when app tries to compare user input (3.30) with number returned by NSNumberFormatter (3.3) it'll show that answer as wrong answer, where is in fact, correct
[03:14:53] <dang`r`us> sepho, store it as a string
[03:15:00] <sepho> sorry for my english :/
[03:15:01] <dang`r`us> sepho, maybe even store a set of strings, like 3.30 and 3,30
[03:15:11] <overbythere> it does seem that 3.3 is less than 3.30, even if they are the same value
[03:15:13] <dang`r`us> that's the easiest way to ensure an exact match if you require one

[03:16:07] <dang`r`us> sepho, apparently you're comparing strings already... or floats
[03:16:08] <sepho> but change that logic is out of time
[03:16:47] <dang`r`us> sepho, are those questions autogenerated or written by hand? (I'm asking because I might suggest different approaches)
[03:16:47] <sepho> the funniest thing is that after NSNumberFormatter, creates a new String with that value
[03:17:00] <sepho> by plist
[03:17:45] <dang`r`us> sepho, I think you have several problems. One of them is, I suppose, that you're using the == operator to compare results
[03:17:46] <real_care> my bad it's actually %.02f
[03:18:03] <dang`r`us> numberFromString: gives you something which you should not compare with ==
[03:18:12] <dang`r`us> because you get an object pointer, so you'd be comparing memory addresses.
[03:18:37] <sepho> dang`r`us:  nop, it uses numberfromstring number to create new NSString and then compare with isEquals
[03:18:44] <dang`r`us> furthermore the value 3.3 (or 3.30, which is the same, value-wise) cannot be represented exactly as a float (that's the internal format your NSNumber* result uses)
[03:18:48] <sepho> this code sucks
[03:19:36] <dang`r`us> sepho, will you ever require more than 2 decimal points precision?
[03:19:59] <sepho> yes
[03:20:04] <dang`r`us> hmmm.
[03:20:14] <sepho> some results are 23.9876 for example
[03:20:21] <sepho> but in that case I have no problem
[03:20:23] <real_care> light your office chair on fire and run away screaming
[03:20:24] <dang`r`us> is this a financial calculation quiz?
[03:20:27] <dang`r`us> or general math?
[03:20:28] <JonathanThompson> There are values you won't be able to get the same thing as if you used a calculator.
[03:20:33] <sepho> because I don't have a zero as last element
[03:21:01] <dang`r`us> for financial I suggest calculating with cents (more precise: "the smallest unit") internally
[03:21:50] <dang`r`us> what is the question whose result is 23.9876 ?
[03:22:04] <sepho> I'll try to use all answers as NSString and see what happensâ¦ nothing good for sure
[03:22:06] <neekers> sepho: if you are working with money, you might want to look into NSNumberFormatterCurrencyStyle
[03:22:45] <sepho> no, it's not, it's like: A farmer bought 396 eggs. Then he sold 15 dozens and 25 eggs broke. How many eggs does he have in good condition?
[03:23:07] <sepho> so in this case I have no decimal :)
[03:23:28] <dang`r`us> sepho, in that case I suggest floats and a required minimum accuracy stored per question
[03:23:31] <JonathanThompson> Where you need no decimal, use no floats :)

[03:23:51] <gregj> what's happening
[03:23:53] <Lyle42> you could multiply by a power of 10 equal to your max precision and use long longs to represent

[05:18:23] <Underbyte-home> the reason why is because the power, sophistication, and *availability* of technology is ever increasing, and whats much scarier is that its increasing at an exponential level, and we my friends are at the 'curve', where things really start to get interesting
[05:19:36] <Underbyte-home> and if we as a society and a species do not manage to get past our petty differences, then quite simply a point will come where one ordinary man will have the power and ability to end all life on earth and in his fanatic, hate-filled state of mind thats exactly what he will do.

[05:44:52] <CarterA> Am I the only one on IRC from the line?
[05:44:55] <jer> roughz, unlikely, what's very likely is that you're hitting memory issues in your app which have fuck all to do with constraints on the queues.
[05:45:05] <jer> roughz, which means, you need to handle your data in a better way
[05:45:22] <jer> if you stream it, ok fine, throw away old data. respond to memory warnings, and throw away a lot of data

[05:48:50] <jer> why not persist some of your items that are queueing up to disk in caches, if you can't just ignore them?
[05:49:22] <jer> if your queue gets over say, 100 items, persist items in batches of N to disk, and release them from your app -- thus freeing up the memory
[05:49:29] <roughz> jer:  problem is, it's quite some heavy codeâ¦ getting data from a websocket, parsing it's xml content, writing it to disk to process laterâ¦.
[05:49:33] <jer> if your queue gets empty, start looking on disk to fill up the queue in a separate thread

[10:10:34] <absentia> you're 11 in base WWDC?

[10:46:58] <MrMadcap> Chance of user-upgradable ram:  Slim to nil.

[11:25:36] <dang`r`us> I'm rather sure you can just ignore the facebook integration if you don't want it

[12:17:36] <jer> kyledr, i'd be ok with only retina devices getting ios 6
[12:17:39] <Codhisattva> rullie: my main (badly explained) point is that Google isn't a software company to the extent that Apple is
[12:17:47] <rullie> I'm surprised there is no update on iMacs
[12:17:49] <dang`r`us> google sells ads

[14:26:04] <DelphiWorld> Codhisattva: also testing welcome, if you want to test any kind of aapp i can test for you
[14:26:05] <rudy> Codhisattva: condolences? huh?
[14:26:06] <sneakyness_wk> how many articles have you seen about android's AMAZING accessibility with their haptic feedbac vs number of articles about blind people taking pictures with an iPHone
[14:26:10] <palmfrond> <sneakyness_wk> haptic is for old people who grew up using analog buttons
[14:26:12] <sneakyness_wk> palmfrond: there's no ignorance here, fact of the matter is it's useless
[14:26:19] <sneakyness_wk> and for old people who used analog buttons
[14:26:25] <Codhisattva> rudy: ML Notifications look a lot like a Growl killer
[14:26:33] <rudy> Codhisattva: pretty sure there will be another sales bump today, in spite of notification suckter

[14:26:34] <palmfrond> wow, k you're a worthless person. i'll disregard you now.
[14:26:40] <Codhisattva> rudy: cool :)
[14:26:59] <DelphiWorld> palmfrond: the worst news today
[14:27:06] <rudy> at least they gave me my on/off switch, Codhisattva, i filed a bug.
[14:27:06] <DelphiWorld> apple support maps accessibility now in VoiceOver
[14:27:09] <palmfrond> DelphiWorld, i'm developing some technology for sightless users. may i private message you?
[14:27:26] <DelphiWorld> open your eyes palmfrond :)
[14:27:44] <palmfrond> haha yes i just got your pm. thanks :) talk with you there
[14:27:55] <DelphiWorld> palmfrond: np :)
[14:28:32] <balrog> haptic feedback can help, but the primitive technology that android phones have doesn't really do much. True, current screen technology is only that capable
[14:28:52] <Codhisattva> balrog: You shall not pass.

[18:27:59] <absentia> lyle: they're f'n with me... won't give me tehtering on my unlimited plan
[18:28:02] <Hauser> like if you were to write a simple clock app, would you use an NSTimer to redraw the time every second?

[18:30:10] <Lyle42> yes do
[18:30:17] <Hauser> asparagui: well nstimer runs in the context of an app so I dunno how accurate I can guarantee it will be, I was hoping to be able to register a thread method with a system wake-up service that would be more accurate
[18:30:43] <asparagui> it will be as accurate as the timer you specify?
[18:30:57] <krazyj> is there any way to have a background for a custom class in IB, ala UIImageView?
[18:30:59] <go2> dirkg: one of many options - http://code.google.com/p/iphone-socks-proxy/

[18:31:07] <Lyle42> aren't
[18:31:10] <asparagui> i have a clock in my app on a one second timer and it updates each second?
[18:31:43] <dirkg> go2 cannot AT&T terminate your contract if you do that
[18:32:06] <go2> dirkg: no ideaâ¦but how can they tell?
[18:32:09] <Hauser> yeah Lyle42, is there a more high precision option? not sure I need it without doing some math to see

[18:32:30] <Hauser> but would be nice to use the higher precision option out of the gate of I can
[18:32:35] <rullie> Hauser: what precision are you looking at
[18:32:39] <dirkg> they can track the number of hops on packets onto their network
[18:32:47] <dirkg> if you have max_hops-1
[18:32:55] <go2> dirkg: true but you are using your own network for last hoop not theirs
[18:32:58] <Hauser> rullie: I'm hoping to redraw the screen with millisecond precision
[18:32:58] <dirkg> then you are obviously using a proxy or tethering
[18:33:00] <go2> last hop
[18:33:05] <Lyle42> depends what you are doing

[18:34:18] <Hauser> heh no
[18:34:21] <absentia> is anything over screen refresh wasted (ie: 60Hz?)
[18:34:25] <Lyle42> yes
[18:34:32] <Hauser> I just need to be able to sync with the receiver to within a millisecond
[18:34:41] <Lyle42> i was just watching an openGL video about that

[18:35:00] <Hauser> there's a clock sync handshake you perform before transmission, but after that you need to march in lockstep, and NSTimer resolution looks like 50-100ms
[18:35:06] <asparagui> Hauser: what are you trying to do?

[18:36:39] <JonathanThompson> I can't help but think that iOS simply can't be used for real-time, but, Hauser, I'd suggest looking at the MIDI stuff: MIDI needs tight timelines even less latency than OpenGL 60 Hz.

[18:38:18] <Lyle42> WWDC 2010 Video Session 414 - OpenGL ES Essential Design Practices talks about the 60fps limit
[18:38:20] <asparagui> what's the time domain on the source?
[18:38:31] <Hauser> the right solution is to ditch the ancient hardware but writing an app is a lot cheaper
[18:39:02] <Hauser> specs I have are 20 frames of 9cm^2 per second and it's twitchy on timing
[18:39:30] <Lyle42> Hauser: my last comment was for you
[18:39:34] <asparagui> +- 50 ms
[18:39:40] <Hauser> has a 1ms resolution timer sync handshake
[18:39:48] <Hauser> thanks Lyle42 I'll check that out
[18:40:14] <Lyle42> yw
[18:41:02] <hyphenated> Hauser: so you need 20 FPS but the exact frame needs to be displayed to the nearest millisecond?
[18:41:03] <asparagui> well, if you have the data, convert it into a video file, then just play that back on a screen?
[18:41:07] <Hauser> asparagui: no the receiver expects to start reading a frame of data at a very precise point in time, it takes 50ms to read the entire frame
[18:41:33] <asparagui> you can sync slave a video deck pretty easy
[18:41:35] <Lyle42> can the reciever detect IR?
[18:41:35] <Hauser> that might work yes to avoid any realtime clock issues, good idea

[18:44:09] <JonathanThompson> I bring this up because audio typically has tighter timing requirements: that's why codecs optimize to ensure proper sound playback over video.
[18:44:52] <Lyle42> they are saying the refresh doesn't exceed 60fps and that faster frame rendering wastes power without visible result

[18:46:25] <Hauser> will do JonathanThompson, this is all new to me
[18:46:27] <JonathanThompson> I've not looked at it in great detail, but if you can find something that requires you fill some buffer every n ms, there you go.
[18:46:37] <absentia> what's the issue?
[18:46:42] <absentia> I have a friend who wrote a sound synth app
[18:46:43] <Hauser> we have a few ios apps but they're all basically fancy web apps, no real time components, so never had to look at these frameworks before
[18:46:48] <absentia> he said it wasn't too difficult.
[18:47:06] <absentia> I have the moog app and the other one with the flying triangles :-)
[18:47:10] <JonathanThompson> absentia: Hauser seems to need better than 60 hz consistently, so I'm thinking perhaps using the timers for audio.
[18:47:18] <absentia> for audio ?
[18:47:22] * JonathanThompson goes away for most of the rest of the evening
[18:47:30] <xissburg> eh
[18:47:30] <absentia> was it jweinburg her--- who was it that was doing all the audio work ?
[18:47:37] <absentia> here
[18:47:37] <Lyle42> having an accurate timer at that resolution won't help if the screen can't keep up
[18:48:01] <JonathanThompson> True, Lyle42, but how accurate does the screen timing need to be for his needs?
[18:48:21] <JonathanThompson> Perhaps he's limited to 60 hz, if it's all optical, in which case, perhaps the audio timers aren't worth the bother.
[18:48:39] * JonathanThompson really leaves this time :P
[18:48:47] <Lyle42> maybe i'm mistaken but from the description it seems like a frame of data, meaning multiple blinks happens inside 50ms
[18:48:51] * absentia j'arrives ...
[18:48:57] <go2> Hauser: look at CADisplayLink
[18:49:00] <Hauser> the screen bandwidth is low but I'm aiming for millisecond timing to render frames
[18:49:05] <DelphiWorld> night people
[18:49:07] <Lyle42> which is way faster than 60fps
[18:49:08] *** Parts: DelphiWorld (~VoCloud@openvpn/user/DelphiWorld) ("http://www.")
[18:49:20] <go2> Hauser: "A CADisplayLink object is a timer object that allows your application to synchronize its drawing to the refresh rate of the display."
[18:49:27] <absentia> 60fps is what... 20 ms?
[18:49:31] * absentia checks his math...
[18:49:33] <Lyle42> you can render frames that fast, but you can't show them all
[18:49:49] <absentia> ~ 16ms
[18:50:10] <Lyle42> that gives  you about 3 blinks per 50ms
[18:50:13] <Lyle42> not much data

[21:40:57] <Lyle42> TheBunny: I will answer your question by deduction ;) studies (that i just made up) show that the most frequent activity during reboot, is resting, there is only one reference to God resting, and it was for one day, since everything else, ie, running the Earth and Hell apps, are dependent on the Heaven OS, we can safely conclude that rebooting Heaven takes one day :D

[23:54:30] <QcMat> when you replace those colored rects with cool stuff
[23:54:44] <A_Nub> Did some headbanging only to realize my physics was fine, but my tweening was wrong!
[23:54:58] <A_Nub> I do some faking of the physics
[23:55:15] <A_Nub> I only use physics to calculate the distance of the rotation upon a swipe
[23:55:23] <A_Nub> then use a tween to animate to it.
[23:55:27] <QcMat> rolled ure own ? or some engine
[23:55:35] <A_Nub> Rolled my own xD

[23:56:41] <A_Nub> With the right amount of trickery this can be used for super awesome UI's
[23:56:44] <A_Nub> I know GL
[23:56:48] <A_Nub> but this isn't for a game :P
[23:56:51] <QcMat> cool A_Nub , it's the way to go hehe
[23:56:54] <A_Nub> So they need to be UIViews
[23:57:05] <QcMat> I do it for more simple physics, I wish I could do it without loosing months for advanced ones
[23:57:09] <QcMat> but for that, I use chipmunk physics
[23:57:21] <A_Nub> Oh I only know simple physics
[23:57:34] <QcMat> me too, you dont need to "know physics" that much to use chipmunk
[23:57:40] <A_Nub> right
[23:57:44] <QcMat> you just need to know the engine a bit
[23:57:54] <A_Nub> I wrote a few of my own super basic physics a while back
[23:57:57] <QcMat> uh, I just tried to tap a error popup on my imac :/
[23:58:00] <k0nichiwa> waht are some other physics engines ?
[23:58:01] <QcMat> too much ipad testing today
[23:58:08] <A_Nub> k0nichiwa: for 2D?
[23:58:09] <k0nichiwa> ive heard o f someting called 'box"
[23:58:10] <A_Nub> Box2D
[23:58:11] <QcMat> Box2D, Chipmunk are the main ones for 2D
[23:58:25] <A_Nub> there is also JelloPhysics if you want softbodies.
[23:58:34] <QcMat> there's also "SimplePhyisics"
[23:58:37] <A_Nub> ^ fun stuff
[23:58:40] <QcMat> which is very simplistic, but can work for some other stuff
[23:58:41] <A_Nub> softbodies are awesome
[23:58:55] <A_Nub> I wrote a javascript 2D cloth simulation a whileback
[23:58:57] <QcMat> box2d has them now, and chipmunk soon, I think chipmunk pro has them already
[23:59:15] <A_Nub> Oh Box does?
[23:59:17] <A_Nub> nice!
